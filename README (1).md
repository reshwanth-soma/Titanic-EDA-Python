# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to explore the Titanic dataset using
statistical and visual methods to identify patterns, trends, and
anomalies related to passenger survival.

## Tools Used

-   Python
-   Pandas
-   Matplotlib
-   Seaborn
-   Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed

1.  **Data Loading**\
    Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

2.  **Dataset Overview**

    -   Checked shape, column names, and data types\
    -   Identified missing values\
    -   Generated basic summary statistics

3.  **Univariate Analysis**

    -   Plotted distributions of Age, Fare, Sex, and Passenger Class\
    -   Observed demographic distributions

4.  **Bivariate Analysis**

    -   Analyzed survival rate by Sex, Pclass, and Age\
    -   Used countplots and boxplots for comparison

5.  **Multivariate Analysis**

    -   Plotted pairplot to visualize relationships\
    -   Generated correlation heatmap for numeric variables

6.  **Observations & Insights**

    -   Females had higher survival rates than males\
    -   First-class passengers were more likely to survive\
    -   Higher fare correlated with better survival chances\
    -   Age showed that children had a better chance of survival

## Deliverables

-   `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook with code and analysis)\
-   `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` (PDF summary of findings)\
-   `README.md` (This file)

## Outcome

Through this task, we practiced using Python and visualization tools to
perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extract meaningful insights
from data.
